## 1.Introduction to Simulator,Design and Testbench

### Simulator 

A simulator is a software tool used to model and analyze the behavior of digital circuits. It is used to simulate a RTL design to verify the adherence of a specification. The simulator which we are going to use here is iverilog.

### Design

Design is a set of verilog codes applied on the design phase of the simulator which has the intended functionality to meet the required specifications of the required digital circuit.

### Testbench 

It is a set of codes or test vectors used to test the functionality of the design as it matches the required specifications or not.

### How simulator works?

A simulator checks for change in input signals and its output is also is determined by the change in input.
